In March of 2019 I decided it was time to finally start a small vegetable garden on the generous 2.5 acre lot we currently live on outside of Cashion, OK. As with most things in my life, if I start on something small, it quickly snowballs into a frenzy of activity. Starting originally with just two simple 6' x 3' beds quickly morphed into four beds and a small composting operation.

Originally I was just planning on running a standard composting bin to collect our food scraps and all of the cardboard boxes we collected from Amazon and the like. A way to break down some material and keep it from going to the landfill with everything else. Soon into the operation I realized we were going to need a much larger compost operation since I was collecting all of the scraps from my work lunches as well. Enjoying a salad and vegetables every day at work for lunch and then again in the evening for dinner quickly fills up your bins.

I started researching different ways people were handling their compost efforts and stumbled onto the idea of vermi-composting. This technique uses red wiggler worms primarily to break down certain food waste and create worm castings which can then be used to boost soil fertility in the raised beds. Organic worm castings are typically about $10 per 2lb bag, which quickly adds up. 

I found three 10 gallon plastic totes and lined them with some coco-coir I had left over, sand from a recent construction project and began to load the bins weekly with vegetable, fruit, paper and cardboard scraps. It took about a week for the worms to get busy once I received them from [Uncle Jim's Worm Farm](https://unclejimswormfarm.com/), but soon they were off and running. Breaking down a lot of our food scrap, leaving small quantities to go into the traditional compost bin outside.

The process seemed to be working just fine until we went on vacation in early July. I don't know if it was the hot temperatures or if the bins just became too acidic or moist. However when we returned home and I went to restock the bins, I quickly learned that the worms had left for greener pastures. I plan to revisit this idea over the winter and find a better way to control moisture levels in the bins when I am not around to monitor on a daily basis.

The process still brought us roughly 30 pounds of worm castings which was a great return. We might have broken even just on the cost of the first batch of worms, and the bins are still usable just need to be modified. If there is anyone looking to experiment with composting, I would encourage them to give this idea a look. I am not advocating a complete worm farm operation, just a couple pounds of worms can grow to take on a single family's compost needs.
