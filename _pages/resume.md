Below you can find a brief overview or the projects I have worked on as well as my professional experience. A hard copy of my resume with professional experience is available [here](/assets/docs/resume.pdf). I have worked with small businesses to design, build and maintain their Wordpress and Squarespace websites.

If you have a project you are interested in speaking about, please find a time convenient for you on my [calendar](https://calendly.com/mattstub/30min) so that we can speak about the project specifics. I look forward to hearing from you!
