Since I can remember I have been taking things apart and tinkering with them. 20 years in the construction industry has only bolstered this personality trait. Most of my passions have always revolved around constructing and deconstructing items. You will find a wide range of topics and ramblings on this site. It is my hope some of the information will be beneficial to you.

Your patience is appreciated while progress on this page continues..
