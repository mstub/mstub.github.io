# Modular Building Systems (Residential)

### Manufactured vs Prefabricated
- manufactured and/or mobile homes fall under the US HUD federal building code
- prefabricated homes must meet the same building codes as traditional sticks/bricks
- prefabricated homes typically qualify for construction and homes loans, unlike manufacturered homes
- bluhomes boasts that it can build a home in-house in 8 weeks, assemble in 1 day, and complete in 2-6 weeks

### Types of Prefab Homes
- **Modular Homes:** consist of one or more modules that are built in a factory, according to state and local codes. Then transported to the site and fit together on site.
 -- Each module comes fully fitted with MEP rough, doors, closets, stairs, etc.
 -- Build times run roughly from three to four months

- **Panelized Homes:** Built in panels, which typically requires more finish work to complete. Modular can be shipped in finished sections, panelized requires cabinets to be constructed and finishes to be applied. Factory construction time to build is still typically the same at 6-12 weeks, however finish site build time is much longer. Might only take a week onsite to construct panels, but a month or more to finish out the interior. Total build time can be 3-5 months.

- **Modular/Panelized Hybrids:** Can take full advantage of the build speed of a modular home to complete the room packages, but then can utilize panelized construction for some exterior walls and roof likes to help change the look of the home.

### Modular Homes
- Most modular homes have a sleek, modern, boxy look because of the modules being built in squares or rectangles.
- These are then stacked or arranged onsite, according to plans
- Some modular homes can also be mixed with panelized walls/roofing to change this appearance

### Panelized Homes
- Can be built in almost any design aesthetic according to the buyer's preference
- Since the panels are assembled on site, there is little that can't be done with the home style.

### Cost Differences with Prefabricated homes
There are a couple reasons why prefab homes tend to cost less than site-built homes:
  - Less Waste. When you have several groups of contractors delivering materials to a site and building a house on location, there’s a lot of waste created in the form of excess materials. When a home is built in panels or modules in a factory, the system can be improved and waste can be reduced.
  - Less Labor and Time. During a traditional build, multiple groups of subcontractors (such as plumbers, electricians, painters, and framers) all come out separately to do their designated work. This work is often delayed or hampered by the work of other subcontractors. When modules or panels are built in-factory, the labor can be more effectively managed so that the work is done quickly and efficiently.

### Quality
But it’s not just the module-to-module framing that makes prefab homes high-quality. Other reasons include:
  - Ongoing Inspections. Prefab homes are inspected and reinspected at every step of the manufacturing process, ensuring that all materials are constructed and built to code. Most site-built homes only go through a single inspection, which means some interior framing problems or shoddy workmanship could sneak by under the radar.
  - Built to Withstand Shipping. Because prefab homes have to be shipped to the building site, they must be able to withstand the shipping process. This means that additional structural support may be added that isn’t added during traditional onsite construction.
  - Built in a Safe Environment. Modular and panelized homes are built in a factory that’s safe from environmental stressors. Materials won’t be affected by extreme weather conditions which can damage a home’s integrity even before it’s built.

### Energy Efficiency
Prefab homes may be more “green” than stick-built homes. There are several reasons for this:
  - Construction Is Less Wasteful. Because everything’s factory-built, there’s less waste in the form of construction materials.
  - Companies Are More Likely to Reuse Waste. The waste that is generated at the factories is often recycled and reused. For instance, many prefab log home manufacturers grind the unused logs and wood into wood chips or pulp to be sold or reused onsite.
  - Seams May Be Tighter. Factory-built homes made with factory-made parts may have tighter seams than traditional stick-built homes, which means less air escapes between rooms or the outside environment. Tight seams helps to contain the heat or air conditioning you use. Also, when room-to-room seams are tighter, you can easily separate your home into zones by opening or closing air vents, ultimately using less energy to heat and cool the areas you use the most.
  - Energy-Efficient Options Are Offered. Many modular homes that offer finishing packages include energy-efficient and sustainable materials, such as Energy Star appliances and cork or bamboo flooring. You may even be able to find modular home builders that offer upgrades to solar panels or energy-efficient tankless water heaters.
